# Seafarers Map Maker

Displays results of a Javascript map-making tool for the game "Catan" and its "Seafarers of Catan" expansion. 

DISCLAIMER: I have no affiliation whatsoever with the makers of the board game, I just like to play it. 
Please buy the board game or app from a retailer if you want to play it. 

This is NOT a game - it is simply a tool for randomizing a map to get ideas for the physical game and HTML5 canvas to display it.
